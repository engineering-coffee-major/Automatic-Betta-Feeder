A simple construction involving a Stepper Motor, 3D printed Parts, &amp; Arduino. 
I have attached the ipt files for the 3D printed parts as well as the Stepper Motor Code 

The Code works on the premise that it rotates every 5 days (You can edit it to whatever duration you like). The time module is also necessary for this code to work.
